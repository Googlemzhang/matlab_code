How to play with this package
------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1. set the matrix to be inverted in MatrixA.m file. Please note that, only constant matrix can be set here.
Step 2. set the activation function in the last line of GnnRightHandSide.m (convergence analysis) and GnnRightHandSideImprecise.m
Step 3. Run the code

Convergence Analysis
>> GnnConvergence(gamma)
where gamma is the parameter to adjust the convergence rate. NB. default value of gamma is 1. 

Robustness Analysis
>> GnnRobust(gamma)
>> GnnNormError(gamma)
